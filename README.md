ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m ShakshiðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about software development, system architecture, and problem-solving. My top programming languages are C++ and Java, and I have a strong interest in functional safety, debugging, and performance optimization.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cloud computing, DevOps (Docker & Kubernetes), and advanced system design to enhance my technical expertise.

ðŸ’ž Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world industry challenges, open-source projects, and cutting-edge technologies that push the boundaries of innovation. Also, if you have internship or job opportunities, feel free to reach out!

ðŸ“§ How to reach me? Simple! Email me at shakshirathore1003@gmail.comâ€”donâ€™t worry, I check my spam folder too!

âš¡ Fun fact: Every rejection is just a step toward success. I document my journey, and one day, Iâ€™ll look back at all the rejections that led to my biggest acceptance. Stay positive and keep building!
